# ABAP enviroment on Cloud 
First hands-on experience with ABAP enviroment on SAP BTP. Created some CDS logic and Fiori Elements annotations with metadata extensions on ABAP trial enviroment.

In this repository I added all the ABAP objects I created in the ABAP trial enviroment (domains, data elements, tables, CDS and business services).
